# Tier 3: point this container's adb at a real device attached outside it, and diagnose it when
# that does not work. The helper CLAUDE.md §4 asks for, "rather than making the author remember it".
#
# THE CONTAINER NEVER TOUCHES USB. It has no /dev/bus/usb, no usbip and no libusb access, and does
# not need any: adb is a client/server protocol over TCP, so on the USB path the container runs only
# the *client* and the server that owns the device runs in WSL (or on Windows). That is why
# `linux-tools-virtual` and `hwdata` belong in the WSL distro, where usbipd-win delivers the device,
# and not in this image — see docs/dev-environment.adoc §9.
#
# OVER WIRELESS DEBUGGING (§9.4) THAT IS INVERTED: no USB device is owned by anyone, the server
# reaches the phone over TCP, and the server therefore belongs *here*. This script supports both, and
# the fact that separates them is not "is a server running in the container" — it is whether that
# server can see a device. An empty list from a container-local server is the USB failure; a
# non-empty one is a working link on either transport.
#
# Read-only and side-effect free by design: it will not start an adb server, because the one thing
# that reliably breaks the USB setup is a server started on the *container* side. Every adb client
# command below runs only after a raw TCP probe has proved one is already answering, since a client
# with nothing to talk to is exactly what starts the bad server.
