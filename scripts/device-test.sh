# Tier 3 — the device test set. Everything under `src/androidTest/` across the project, run against
# a real phone (or an emulator, if that is what is attached).
#
# WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM CI, AND STAYS SEPARATE
#
# `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs yamllint, shellcheck, `ktlintCheck`, `detekt`, `lint`, `test` and
# both APK builds — and nothing else.
# `connectedDebugAndroidTest` is not in it and must not be added: GitHub's runners have no
# device, so the job could only ever be skipped, fail, or spin up an emulator whose whole purpose is
# to *not* be the thing these tests exist to check. The isolation is therefore structural rather
# than a matter of tagging: a test in `src/test/` runs on CI, a test in `src/androidTest/` runs here.
#
# WHAT THIS SET IS FOR
#
# Three things the JVM suite cannot reach, in rough order of how much they have actually cost:
#
#   1. **Android-vs-JVM behavioural deviations.** Regexes compiled by ICU rather than
#      `java.util.regex`, locale-sensitive case conversion, ICU date formatting, the device's own
#      SQLite. `docs/decisions/0017` exists because one of these shipped a bug past 437 green tests.
#   2. **Platform surfaces with no test double worth trusting** — SAF writes, the Keystore cipher,
#      a foreground service actually starting, the cleartext-traffic policy.
#   3. **UI conformance to `docs/UI.adoc`** on a real Compose runtime.
#
# ⚠ THIS UNINSTALLS AND REINSTALLS THE APP, SO IT WIPES ITS DATA
#
# `connectedAndroidTest` installs the app and its test package, and an install that cannot replace
# the existing one uninstalls it first. On a phone that has been used for real that costs the
# Nextcloud login, the SAF folder grant, and — the part that matters — **the episode ledger**, which
# CLAUDE.md §5 calls the one table that must never be lost.
#
# Downloaded files are unaffected: they live in the user's own folder, not in app storage.
#
# So: export a backup from Settings first if the install holds anything you want to keep, and expect
# to reconnect Nextcloud afterwards. Restoring that backup is itself gated on being connected again
# (`docs/decisions/0018`), which is the intended order rather than an obstacle.
#

# One device, named explicitly, for everything below — Gradle *and* the raw adb calls at the end.

# `adb` and AGP both honour ANDROID_SERIAL, so exporting it is the whole mechanism; nothing here

# than the exotic one: over wireless debugging (docs/dev-environment.adoc §9.4) a stale
# `emulator-5554` or a previous `<ip>:<port>` entry sits alongside the phone, and Gradle then fails
# with "found 2 devices" rather than picking one. An ANDROID_SERIAL the caller already set wins,
# which is how you choose between them.

# NotificationIconConformanceTest and MarkLegibilityConformanceTest had never run on a device

# :app IS DELIBERATELY RUN BY HAND, AND THIS IS NOT PREMATURE CLEVERNESS.
#
# `:app:connectedDebugAndroidTest` cannot install on a usbip-attached phone: UTP's own installer
# fails on the ~58 MB app APK with `AndroidTestApkInstallerPlugin ErrorCode: 2002 — Failed to install
# APK`, producing a report that reads `tests="0" failures="0"` while Gradle announces "There were
# failing tests". Everything else about the run is fine — the same two APKs install in seconds with
# `adb install` using AGP's own flags (`-r -g`), and the tests then pass.
#
# Ruled out, each by experiment rather than by reading:
#   - a stale package         — clearing every podsilo package changed nothing
#   - AGP's install timeout   — `installation { timeOutInMs }` at 30 min made no difference
#   - the permission flags    — `adb install -r -g` of both APKs succeeds every time
#   - disabling UTP           — `useUnifiedTestPlatform=false` is deprecated and ignored in AGP 9
#
# So the install goes through adb and the run through `am instrument`, which is the same runner
# Gradle would have invoked. This is a workaround for one broken tool path on one transport, not a
# replacement for Gradle — hence it stays in this script rather than becoming a Gradle task.

# The app APK is NOT `app-debug.apk`. `androidComponents.onVariants` in app/build.gradle.kts renames
# it to `podsilo-<versionName>-debug.apk`, and that rename applies only to the *main* variant — the
# androidTest APK keeps AGP's default name. Globbing rather than hardcoding the version keeps this
# working when versionName changes.
#
# This was a real fault: the hardcoded `app-debug.apk` kept resolving to a months-old file left in
# that directory from before the rename, so the run silently tested a stale build. Failing loudly
# when the glob matches nothing is the point.
#
# A `nullglob` array rather than `ls | head -1`: the glob expands to nothing when there is no match
# (which the check below is waiting for) and it never parses a filename out of ls's output
# (ShellCheck SC2012). Expansion is sorted, so "first match" means what it meant before.

# A test that opts out with `assumeTrue` is neither run nor reported: `am instrument` prints
# "OK (6 tests)" for six tests that all threw `AssumptionViolatedException` and took 0.135 s between
# them. `SafDownloadTargetInstrumentedTest` skips exactly that way when no SAF folder has been
# granted — and this script's own uninstall removes the grant, so the six tests it most needs to run
# are the six most likely to silently not.
#
# That is not hypothetical: it is how "41 instrumented tests green" got claimed on 2026-08-03 when
# 35 had run. Skips are now counted and reported, and the run is not called green while any exist.

# TROUBLESHOOTING
#
# `Failed to install APK … ErrorCode: 2002` with "Starting 0 tests" is the UTP install failure
# described above — not a test result. It is why :app is run by hand here. If a future AGP fixes it,
# collapse this script back to a single `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest`.
