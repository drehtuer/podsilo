 *
 * **Resumable.** A partial file left by a cancelled or failed attempt is continued with a `Range`
 * request. Servers that ignore `Range` (answering 200 with the whole body) and servers that reject
 * it (416, typically because the file changed underneath us) are both handled by restarting from
 * zero rather than corrupting the file by appending to a stale prefix.
 *
 * Failures are [EnclosureDownloadResult] values, not exceptions (CLAUDE.md §8) — a podcast CDN
 * being down is entirely expected. Cancellation is the one thing that does propagate: WorkManager
 * cancels the coroutine, and the half-written file is deliberately left behind for the next attempt
 * to resume from.
