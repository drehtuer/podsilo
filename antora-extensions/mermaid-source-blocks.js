/**
 * Lets one spelling of a Mermaid block work in both places it is read.
 *
 * GitHub renders Mermaid inside .adoc only from `[source,mermaid]`. asciidoctor-kroki
 * renders only `[mermaid]`. Writing either one breaks the other, and these diagrams
 * are read in both — in the repository while working, on the site while reading.
 *
 * So the files keep `[source,mermaid]`, which is the form that survives being browsed
 * on GitHub, and this rewrites it to `[mermaid]` in the aggregated content, after the
 * files are read and before Asciidoctor sees them. Nothing on disk changes.
 *
 * Deliberately a string replacement on the block declaration line rather than a
 * parsed transformation: the declaration is unambiguous, and a tree processor would
 * have to reproduce what asciidoctor-kroki already does with the block it is handed.
