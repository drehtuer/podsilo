     * that through its own `SystemForegroundService`, which declares no `foregroundServiceType`; and
     * from API 34 the runtime type must be a subset of the manifest's. It was not, so the framework
     * threw inside its own service dispatch — a hard process kill the worker could not catch, which
     * WorkManager's retry then turned into a crash loop.
     *
     * There is a Robolectric version of this in `:app`'s unit tests reading the merged manifest, and
     * it is the one that will fail fastest. This one is worth keeping anyway: it asks the **device's
     * own `PackageManager`**, after installation, which is the authority the framework actually
     * consults.
