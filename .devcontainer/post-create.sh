# --- Runtime ownership / group repair -------------------------------------------
# The image bakes USER_UID/USER_GID/KVM_GID/DOCKER_GID in as build args, but the
# values that actually matter belong to the *host*, and they differ per machine.
# Two things then go wrong that no build arg can fix from inside the image:
#
#   1. The devcontainer CLI rewrites this user's UID/GID at container start
#      (updateRemoteUserUID) to match the host user, and chowns only $HOME. On a
#      host whose UID is not USER_UID, $ANDROID_HOME (a named volume, initialised
#      from the image's ownership) is left owned by a stranger.
#   2. /dev/kvm and the bind-mounted /var/run/docker.sock carry the *host's* GIDs,
#      which need not be the ones the image created.
#
# Both were hit for real when this project moved to a second machine (host uid
# 1002, docker gid 108). sdkmanager's failure mode for (1) is silent and
# genuinely misleading: `--licenses` prints "All SDK package licenses accepted"
# while writing nothing at all, and the install that follows then prompts
# "Accept? (y/N):" against a closed stdin and skips every package. So repair the
# ownership here, at runtime, where the real IDs are knowable — rather than
# asking every host to edit devcontainer.json first.
