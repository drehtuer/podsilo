# opodsync (https://github.com/kd2org/opodsync, AGPL-3.0) ships no Dockerfile of its
# own — it is plain PHP + SQLite intended to be dropped into a webroot — so this
# builds a minimal one. We only *run* this server for tests; we never link against
# it or ship it, so its AGPL licence does not reach Podsilo (CLAUDE.md §2/§4).

# Pinned to a tag rather than a moving branch, per CLAUDE.md §3's "no floating
# versions" spirit. Bump deliberately. 0.5.3 is the newest tag as of 2026-07-31 —
# note opodsync has never released a 1.x; the upstream version line is 0.x.
ARG OPODSYNC_REF=0.5.3

# No PHP extensions to install: php:8.3-apache already has sqlite3, pdo_sqlite and
# json compiled in (verified with `php -m`), which is opodsync's full requirement
# set (README: "PHP 7.4+ and SQLite3 with JSON1"). It uses the procedural \SQLite3
# class, not PDO. curl is here for the compose healthcheck; git for the clone.

# opodsync's .htaccess is load-bearing, not cosmetic: `FallbackResource /index.php`
# is what routes the virtual API paths (/index.php/apps/gpoddersync/...) into the
# front controller, and the `SetEnvIf Authorization` line is what makes the Basic
# auth header visible to PHP at all. Debian's apache2.conf ships AllowOverride None
# for /var/www/, which silently ignores the file — every API call then 404s and auth
# never arrives. Overriding it is mandatory.
